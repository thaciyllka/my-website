            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821â€“1881) is considered one of the most profound literary minds in history. Born in Moscow, his tumultuous life experiences, including imprisonment in Siberia, shaped his writing. 
                    Dostoevsky's works delve into complex themes such as morality, free will, and human suffering, making him a pioneer of existentialism.
